## Features ✨

### 1. **Data Ingestion API**  
- APIs to accept and store customer and order data in a database.  
- Demonstration via Postman for data validation and successful population of tables.  
- **Bonus:** Implemented a scalable pub-sub architecture using a message broker for validated data.

### 2. **Campaign & Audience Management**  
- **Audience Segmentation:**  
  - Define audience segments using AND/OR logic across multiple conditions such as:  
    - Total spending > INR 10,000  
    - Spending > INR 10,000 and visits <= 3  
    - Customers inactive for the last 3 months  
  - Real-time calculation of audience size before saving.  

- **Campaign History & Stats:**  
  - Google-based authentication for secure access.  
  - View past campaigns in reverse chronological order.  

- **Message Sending:**  
  - Save audience data in a `communications_log` table.  
  - Dummy API to send personalized messages (e.g., “Hi [Name], here’s 10% off on your next order!”).  
  - Integrated “Delivery Receipt” API to update communication statuses with randomized delivery results (90% SENT, 10% FAILED).  
  - **Bonus:** Batched database updates via pub-sub model.  
  - Campaign statistics displayed, including audience size, sent messages, and failures.
